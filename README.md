# üéÆ F2P Database

This is the front end user interface for a database of free to play games. The goal of this project was to provide a way for gamers, with little to no money, an easy way to find new games to play. This project was also used as a way for me to start using Tyepscript in a project. I hope you enjoy looking through the database and find a game that you like!

## üìù Context

This project was created by one developer, me! It took an estimated 50 hours to complete this project at time of writing. These 50 hours were spread out over the course of a week. It's purpose was to act as a final showcase project at Turing School of Software & Design.

For managing the project tasks, I used a mix of Github Projects with some note taking. If anyone intrested, here's the [mockups and wireframes](https://www.figma.com/design/MYzvvy3Uuj2HjFg2tWz3jg/Untitled?node-id=3-95&t=9bv8EULXCqVQd67N-0) I came up with!
## üìö Lessons Learned

While working on this project, a big thing I ran into was realizing my limiations as a developer. Many of the projects I had been working on to this point were group projects so I (as a team) was able to get a lot of work done. Having done done a solo project in a while, I realized how long some tasks take, even if I know every step to get there.

It was fun learning Typescript for this project. I realized a lot of the benefits that adding it into Javascript beyond simple type safety. Some things that I found intresting were: it's makes for great autocomplete, the Typescript compiler is great at catching errors for me. It was also surprisingly easy to integrate it with other packages, even if the author did not include it originally. Using it felt like a good balance between other heavy languages like Java and the lightness of Javascript.

Looking back, I realized that I used a decent amount of npm packages. The reasoning behind this was that, given only a week, it was unfeasible to program everything myself. In the future I'd like to spend time leanring to program all the features I offloaded to npm packages on my own. For example: being able to make a carousel or a fuzzsort alogrithm. Some things I think are fine just using a package such as Error Boundary. I already understand how it works and don't see any benefit in implementing it myself.
## üõ§Ô∏è Roadmap

- Light mode / dark mode
- User authentication
- Creating my own backend API and not relying on a public API
- Add a database so users can store information such as reviews or submit there games
- Moderatorating capabilities for managing this website 
- Add in a component library
- Furthur CSS styling improvements
